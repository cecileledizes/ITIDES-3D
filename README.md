This article provides a detailed description of the numerical method implemented in this source code, as well as validation cases and theoretical background.

### Getting started
#### Dependencies
This program is a parallel code in Python, using the following packages : numpy, scipy, os, sys, json, time, logging, petsc4py, mpi4py, matplolib.

#### Executing program
To run the program, the user 
```python main.py casename.json```


#### Program structure
The file **main.py** calls the two following functions : 
* *compute_source_distribution(comm,casefile)* from **source_distribution.py** :
This function reads the casefile containing informations on the frequencies, the maximum number of modes and the solver to use, as well as the topography file (with the data on the bathymetry). The function then computes the matrix M in parallel using the dimensionless values of the 
topography and solves the boundary integral equation using a linear solver from the petsc4py package.
Once the source distribution is computed, it is saved in the sourcefile.
* *compute_wavefield(comm, casefile, list_pmax)*  from **wavefield.py** :
This function reads the casefile as well as the sourcefile, to compute the convolution gn*S and saves in the output file wavefile the dimensionless values
of the modal velocities -un,vn,wn-, the modal pressure -pn-, as well as the modal energy flux -Jn_x, Jn_y- and conversion rate Cn.

All the input and output files are detailled in the next section.


Several other python files are also contained in the project : 
* **topographyGeneration.py** : generates topography files for simple idealised topographies (gaussian, bumps, ...)
* **generateCasefile.py** : generates the casefile (in the json format) and the topography file
* **plots.py** : contains all the functions to plot the topography, the source distribution or the wavefield
* various test files ...


### Input files
#### Casefile
The casefile is a .json file containing the following dictionnary, with information on the frequencies omega and f, the stratification and the topography.

```

#### Topography 
The topography file is a .npy file containing the discrete topography. It is a .npy file with the following dictionary. Topography files can be generated by the program topographyGeneration.py for simple seamounts.
```
topofile = {
    "delta" : float,           # Size of square cell (m)
    
    # Flattened topography
    "x"     : array (Ntot),    # Array of x-coordinate (m) (size Ntot = nX*nY = total number of cells)
    "y"     : array (Ntot),    # Array of y-coordinate (m)
    "h"     : array (Ntot),    # Array of topography height (m)
    "dh_x"  : array (Ntot),    # Array of topography x-slope
    "dh_y"  : array (Ntot),    # Array of topography y-slope
    
    # For rectangular topography
    "xx"    : array (nX),      # Array of x-coordinate (size nX = number of cells in the x-direction)
    "yy"    : array (nY),      # Array of y-coordinate (size nY = number of cells in the y-direction)
    "hh"    : array (nX,nY),   # Array of topography height
    "dhh_x" : array (nX,nY),   # Array of topography x-slope
    "dhh_y" : array (nX,nY),   # Array of topography y-slope
